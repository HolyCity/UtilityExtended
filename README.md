# UtilityExtended
A cross platform audio plugin with various utility parameters

This was initially developed in RackAFX (TM), a cross platform development tool by Will Pirkle (www.willpirkple.com). If you want to play around with this code, I recommend you download it, create a new project named UtilityExtended, and copy/paste the files in this repository.
